def get_section_changes(transcript_text):
    system_prompt = "You are an expert transcript analyzer. Your job is to detect when new sections start in a Spanish Listening Comprehension exam and output their timestamps in the required format."

    user_prompt = f"""
You are given a transcript of a Listening Comprehension exam. The exam contains multiple sections, each introduced with timestamps (e.g., [00:00 - 00:21]) and section labels like "1. Anuncio", "2. Entrevista", etc.

Each section is typically **repeated up to 3 times**, but you must **only include the first time** each section appears.

üéØ Your task:
- Detect when a **new section** starts.
- For sections numbered 1-7, extract the section number and the timestamp in seconds.
- Ignore the introduction section.

üìå Notes:
- Ignore repeated replays of the same section.
- Only include sections labeled with numbers (1 through 7).
- Use the timestamp to determine the exact start time in seconds.

üì¶ Return format:
You must return a JSON object with this exact structure:
{{
    "1": {{
        "seconds": 59.1
    }},
    "2": {{
        "seconds": 323.6
    }},
    ... (and so on for sections 3-7)
}}

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: 
- Section numbers must be strings, not integers in the final JSON
- Only include the section number and seconds, no labels or descriptions
- Be precise with the seconds, using decimal points if needed

Now, here is the transcript:
