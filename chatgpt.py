    if lang_code == "ga":
        user_prompt = f"""
You are given a transcript of a listening comprehension exam in {lang_code} language. The exam contains multiple sections, each introduced with timestamps (e.g., [00:00 - 00:21]) and section labels like "1. [Section Name]", "2. [Section Name]", or section names in their respective languages (e.g., Cuid A for Irish).

Each section is typically **repeated up to 3 times**, but you must **only include the first time** each section appears.

üéØ Your task:
- Detect when each of the **first three sections** begins.
- Each section corresponds to a part of the paper:
    - Section A = 1
    - Section B = 2
    - Section C = 3
- Extract the section number and the **timestamp in seconds** of when it begins.

üìå Notes:
- Ignore any introductions or repeated replays.
- Convert local numbering systems (e.g., "Ceist a haon") to Arabic numerals: 1, 2, 3.
- Only detect and return the **first appearance** of sections 1, 2, and 3.

üì¶ Return format:
Return a JSON object with this exact structure:
{{
    "1": {{
        "seconds": [timestamp]
    }},
    "2": {{
        "seconds": [timestamp]
    }},
    "3": {{
        "seconds": [timestamp]
    }}
}}

‚ö†Ô∏è Important:
- Section numbers must be strings ("1", "2", "3")
- Do not include any extra fields, labels, or explanations
- Use decimal points in seconds (e.g., 59.1)
- If a section is missing, do not include it in the output

Each section is typically **repeated up to 3 times**, but you must **only include the first time** each section appears.

üéØ Your task:
- Detect when a **new section** starts.
- For sections numbered 1-7, extract the section number and the timestamp in seconds. (not every language has 7 sections)
- Ignore the introduction section.

üìå Notes:
- Ignore repeated replays of the same section.
- Only include sections labeled with numbers (1 through 7).
- Use the timestamp to determine the exact start time in seconds, if unsure, be generous.
- If a language uses different numbering systems, convert to standard Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3).

üì¶ Return format:
You must return a JSON object with this exact structure:
{{
    "1": {{
        "seconds": 59.1
    }},
    "2": {{
        "seconds": 323.6
    }},
    ... (and so on for sections 3-7)
}}

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: 
- Section numbers must be strings, not integers in the final JSON
- Only include the section number and seconds, no labels or descriptions
- Be precise with the seconds, using decimal points if needed
- If a section is missing or cannot be found, do not include it in the output
Remember, include the start of the question
